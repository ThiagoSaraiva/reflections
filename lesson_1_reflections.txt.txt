How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Examining just the changes.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It is always good to know everything that happened over time.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    You can personilize the time of the commits, but maybe you are not sure about how to personilize.
	
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because when you are writing code, you can have more than you file related to the same changes.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Just enter them.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I am sure I can come back to the previous state.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    My project.
